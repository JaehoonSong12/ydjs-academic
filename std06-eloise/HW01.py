    This function calculates the tip for a food delivery and splits the 
    total cost (including the tip) among friends.

    Steps:
    1. Ask the user for the order total (positive integer).
    2. Ask the user for the tip percentage they want to give the driver (positive integer).
    3. Ask the user for the number of friends splitting the total (positive integer).
    4. Calculate the tip using the formula:
       Tip = (Order Total x Tip Percentage) / 100.
    5. Calculate the total cost by adding the tip to the order total.
    6. Divide the total cost by the number of friends to get the amount each friend must pay.
    7. Round the tip and each friend's share to 2 decimal places.
    8. Print the tip and the amount each friend must pay.

    Assumptions:
    - All inputs are positive integers.
    - Outputs are rounded to 2 decimal places for clarity.

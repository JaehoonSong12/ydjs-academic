compareTo, 

0 (Zero):

Indicates that the current object is equal to the specified object.
Example: obj1.compareTo(obj2) == 0
Negative Value:

Indicates that the current object is less than the specified object.
Example: obj1.compareTo(obj2) < 0
Positive Value:

Indicates that the current object is greater than the specified object.
Example: obj1.compareTo(obj2) > 0

"apple".compareTo("banana") // Returns a negative value because "apple" < "banana"
"banana".compareTo("apple") // Returns a positive value because "banana" > "apple"
"apple".compareTo("apple")  // Returns 0 because both are equal

Key Points:
Negative: Current object is smaller (comes earlier in order).
Zero: Both objects are equal in order.
Positive: Current object is larger (comes later in order).

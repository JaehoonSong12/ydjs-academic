## Course Description
Introduction to computing principles and programming practices with an emphasis on the design, construction and implementation of problem solutions use of software tools. This README provides step-by-step instructions for each homework.
1. Lecture notes are available in `docs` subdiectory in the root direcotry.
2. Homeworks will be modularized and will never be modified upon release by instructors.

## Course Objectives
- To understand the basic concepts of computer programming in a high-level language.
- To be able to use and combine control flow constructs to form useful programs.
- To understand and become familiar with a number of simple data structures.
- To understand the process and skills necessary to effectively deal with problem solving in relation to writing programs.
- To be able to test and debug programs.
- To understand and employ functions and modularity.
- Through labs become comfortable with common software packages in use today.

# HW00: Tutorial
To get started with your homework assignments, follow the steps below.

```
Instructions will be added soon
```

<!-- ## Set Up Your Virtual Environment (Activate venv)
Before running any code, make sure you have your virtual environment set up.

- If you haven't set up a virtual environment yet, follow the setup instructions provided in the root repository.
- If you don't have `venv` like folder name and VSCode bash session does not show you `(venv)` on top, that means you need to setup a virtual environment

Finally, to activate the venv, run the following script.
```bash
source venv/Scripts/activate
```

## Open VSCode in this directory
This `src` (source code) directory is where you are going to actually code. Open your VS Code here to proceed.


## Check Python Version
Make sure that Python is virtually executing and the correct version is available in your virtual environment.

Run the following command to check your Python virtual environment:
```bash
python --version
```

## Execution of Application with Environment Setup
Once you check `python --version`, you can now run your application. Simply type in the following command.
```bash
./run.sh
```

## Direct Execution of Application
Once you check `python --version`, you can now run your application. Simply type in the following command.
```bash
python main/python/cli.py
``` -->


## Do Homework

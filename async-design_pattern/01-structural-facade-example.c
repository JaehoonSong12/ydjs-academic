/**
 * @brief Facade function for printing strings.
 *
 * This function acts as a facade to simplify string output. Instead of requiring the caller
 * to manually format strings with newlines and handle the underlying formatting and printing
 * details, this function encapsulates that complexity. It uses snprintf to format the string
 * with a newline character and then calls printf to output it.
 *
 * This implementation demonstrates the Facade design pattern. The Facade pattern provides a
 * simple interface to a more complex subsystem. In this case, the complexity of string formatting
 * and printing is hidden behind the simple interface of the print function. This makes the code easier
 * to read, maintain, and reuse.
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Simplifies the interface for printing strings.
 * - Hides the underlying formatting and printing logic.
 * - Promotes code reuse and adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
 *
 * @param str The string to be printed.

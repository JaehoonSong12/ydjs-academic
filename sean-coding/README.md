# Alice 3 - Educational Programming Environment

## What is Alice?
Alice 3 is an **educational programming environment** developed by **Carnegie Mellon University** to help beginners learn object-oriented programming. It provides a visual, drag-and-drop interface to create 3D animations, interactive stories, and simple games.

### Key Features:
- **Block-based programming** for easy learning.
- **Transition to Java** for advanced coding practice.
- **Prebuilt 3D assets** including characters, props, and environments.
- **Educational focus** to teach programming concepts.

## Games Made with Alice 3
Alice 3 is primarily used for educational purposes, so most "games" created with it are small-scale student projects. Examples include:
- **Simple platformers**
- **Basic adventure games**
- **Interactive storytelling projects**
- **Mini-puzzle games**
- **Educational simulations**

Since Alice 3 is not a professional game engine, it is not used for commercial game development. If you are looking for a game engine to develop full-scale games, consider **Unity, Unreal Engine, or Godot**.

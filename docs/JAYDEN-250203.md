# Math: SAT














![Triangle Inequality Theorem](./images/Triangle-Inequality-Theorm.webp)




## Triangle Inequality Theorem  




The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that:  




> The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be *greater* than the length of the third side.




### Math Terms
For any triangle with sides a, b, and c:  
- a + b > c  
- a + c > b  
- b + c > a




---




### 1 Example
If the sides are 3, 4, and 8:  
- 3 + 4 = 7, which is not greater than 8.  
*No triangle can be formed.


---


### 2 Example
If the sides are 3, 4, and 6:  
- *3 + 4 = 7, which is greater than 6.  
 A triangle can be formed  




---




### Real-Life Analogy




Think of a triangle as a path:  
- You want to walk from Point A to Point B to Point C.  
- If two paths are too short, it’s like walking in a straight line—no triangle is possible.  




**Key Idea**: You can’t “bend” short sides to form a triangle.  




---




### Key Rule




For any triangle with sides a, b, and c:  




- a + b > c
- a + c > b  
- b + c > a  




If even **one** of these is false, you **cannot** form a triangle!  




---




### Practice Problems




1. Can a triangle have sides 5, 7, and 12?  
   A: No(Jayden)
2. Can a triangle have sides 6, 8, and 1?  
   A: Yes(Jayden)
3. Can a triangle have sides 2, 2, and 5?  
   A: No(Jayden)
4. Can a triangle have sides 4, 4, and 7?  
   A: Yes(Jayden)




---




### Conclusion




The **Triangle Inequality Theorem** ensures a triangle can exist. Always check:  




> The sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.




Remember: No Sum, No Triangle!

## Factored Form
> Factored form is a way of writing a mathematical expression as a product of its factors. For example, instead of expanding an equation like x²+5x+6, you write it as (x+2)(x+3), which shows its factors.




### Example
![Factored Form](./images/Factored_Form_EX.png)


1. **Factoring Out the GCF**  
   Factor 12x² + 18x:  
   GCF = 6x
   Here is retyped example! $12 x^2$
   Here is retyped example! 
   $$
    12x^2+18x = 6x(2x+3)
   $$



2. **Factoring a Trinomial**  
   Factor $x^2 + 7x + 10$:  
   Find numbers that multiply to 10 and add to 7 → 2 and 5.  
   x² + 7x + 10 = (x + 2)(x + 5)




3. **Factoring by Grouping**
   Factor 2x³ + 4x² + 3x + 6:  
   Group terms: (2x³ + 4x²) + (3x + 6)  
   Factor GCF: 2x²(x + 2) + 3(x + 2)
   Combine: (2x² + 3)(x + 2)




4. **Factoring a Difference of Squares**  
   Factor x² - 49:  
   x² - 49 = (x + 7)(x - 7)






---




### Steps




Follow these steps to factor any expression:




1. Look for a **GCF**:  
   Factor out the greatest common factor from all terms.




2. Count the terms:  
   - 2 terms → Check for a difference of squares.  
   - 3 terms → Factor as a trinomial.  
   - 4 terms → Try factoring by grouping.  




3. Factor step by step:  
   Use methods like the **AC Method** for trinomials.




4. Check for special cases:  
   Recognize patterns like perfect squares or differences of squares.




5. Verify:  
   Expand your factors to ensure they match the original expression.

### Types of Factoring




**Factoring Out the GCF**




Always start by factoring out the **greatest common factor**.  




Example:  
- 6x² + 12x
- GCF = 6x
- 6x² + 12x = 6x(x + 2)  










**Factoring Trinomials**




For an expression in the form **ax² + bx + c**:  
- Find two numbers that multiply to ac and add to b.




Example:  
x² + 5x + 6
The numbers that *multiply* to 6 and add to 5 are **2 and 3**.  
x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)




**Factoring by Grouping**




Use grouping when there are **4 terms**.  




Example:  
x³ + 2x² + x + 2

Group terms:  
(x³ + 2x²) + (x + 2)  
Factor out the GCF from each group:  
x²(x + 2) + 1(x + 2)
Combine:  
(x² + 1)(x + 2)  




**Factoring Special Cases**




1. Difference of Squares:  
   a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)




   Example:  
   x² - 16 = (x + 4)(x - 4)




2. Perfect Square Trinomials:  
   - a² + 2ab + b² = (a + b)²  
   - a² - 2ab + b² = (a - b)²  




   Example:  
   - x² + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)²

# Math: SAT














![Triangle Inequality Theorem](./images/Triangle-Inequality-Theorm.webp)




## Triangle Inequality Theorem  




The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that:  




> The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be *greater* than the length of the third side.




### Math Terms
For any triangle with sides a, b, and c:  
- a + b > c  
- a + c > b  
- b + c > a




---




### 1 Example
If the sides are 3, 4, and 8:  
- 3 + 4 = 7, which is not greater than 8.  
*No triangle can be formed.


---


### 2 Example
If the sides are 3, 4, and 6:  
- *3 + 4 = 7, which is greater than 6.  
 A triangle can be formed  




---




### Real-Life Analogy




Think of a triangle as a path:  
- You want to walk from Point A to Point B to Point C.  
- If two paths are too short, it’s like walking in a straight line—no triangle is possible.  




**Key Idea**: You can’t “bend” short sides to form a triangle.  




---




### Key Rule




For any triangle with sides a, b, and c:  




- a + b > c
- a + c > b  
- b + c > a  




If even **one** of these is false, you **cannot** form a triangle!  




---




### Practice Problems




1. Can a triangle have sides 5, 7, and 12?  
   A: No(Jayden)
2. Can a triangle have sides 6, 8, and 1?  
   A: Yes(Jayden)
3. Can a triangle have sides 2, 2, and 5?  
   A: No(Jayden)
4. Can a triangle have sides 4, 4, and 7?  
   A: Yes(Jayden)




---




### Conclusion




The **Triangle Inequality Theorem** ensures a triangle can exist. Always check:  




> The sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.




Remember: No Sum, No Triangle!




---




## Factored Form
> Factored form is a way of writing a mathematical expression as a product of its factors. For example, instead of expanding an equation like x²+5x+6, you write it as (x+2)(x+3), which shows its factors.




### Example
![Factored Form](./images/Factored_Form_EX.png)


1. **Factoring Out the GCF**  
   Factor 12x² + 18x:  
   GCF = 6x
   Here is retyped example! $12 x^2$
   Here is retyped example! 
   $$
    12x^2+18x = 6x(2x+3)
   $$



2. **Factoring a Trinomial**  
   Factor $x^2 + 7x + 10$:  
   Find numbers that multiply to 10 and add to 7 → 2 and 5.  
   x² + 7x + 10 = (x + 2)(x + 5)




3. **Factoring by Grouping**
   Factor 2x³ + 4x² + 3x + 6:  
   Group terms: (2x³ + 4x²) + (3x + 6)  
   Factor GCF: 2x²(x + 2) + 3(x + 2)
   Combine: (2x² + 3)(x + 2)




4. **Factoring a Difference of Squares**  
   Factor x² - 49:  
   x² - 49 = (x + 7)(x - 7)






---




### Steps




Follow these steps to factor any expression:




1. Look for a **GCF**:  
   Factor out the greatest common factor from all terms.




2. Count the terms:  
   - 2 terms → Check for a difference of squares.  
   - 3 terms → Factor as a trinomial.  
   - 4 terms → Try factoring by grouping.  




3. Factor step by step:  
   Use methods like the **AC Method** for trinomials.




4. Check for special cases:  
   Recognize patterns like perfect squares or differences of squares.




5. Verify:  
   Expand your factors to ensure they match the original expression.




---




### Types of Factoring




**Factoring Out the GCF**




Always start by factoring out the **greatest common factor**.  




Example:  
- 6x² + 12x
- GCF = 6x
- 6x² + 12x = 6x(x + 2)  










**Factoring Trinomials**




For an expression in the form **ax² + bx + c**:  
- Find two numbers that multiply to ac and add to b.




Example:  
x² + 5x + 6
The numbers that *multiply* to 6 and add to 5 are **2 and 3**.  
x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)




**Factoring by Grouping**




Use grouping when there are **4 terms**.  




Example:  
x³ + 2x² + x + 2

Group terms:  
(x³ + 2x²) + (x + 2)  
Factor out the GCF from each group:  
x²(x + 2) + 1(x + 2)
Combine:  
(x² + 1)(x + 2)  




**Factoring Special Cases**




1. Difference of Squares:  
   a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)




   Example:  
   x² - 16 = (x + 4)(x - 4)




2. Perfect Square Trinomials:  
   - a² + 2ab + b² = (a + b)²  
   - a² - 2ab + b² = (a - b)²  




   Example:  
   - x² + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)²  




---








### Tips for Factoring




- Always start by factoring out the **GCF**.  
- Recognize patterns like perfect squares or differences of squares.  
- Use the **AC Method** to factor trinomials efficiently.  
- Expand your factors to check your work.  




---




### Practice Problems




1. Factor **x² + 8x + 15**.  
   Jayden A: (x+3)(x+5)
2. Factor **3x² + 12x + 9**.  
   Jayden A: (3x+3)(x+3)
3. Factor **x² - 36**.
   Jayden A: (x+6)(x-6)
4. Factor **4x³ + 8x² + 2x + 4**.
   Jayden A: 2(2x² + 1)(x + 2)
5. Factor **x³ - x² - 6x + 6**.  
   Jayden A: (x-1)(x²-6)




---




### Conclusion




Factored form is a fundamental concept in algebra that simplifies polynomials and helps solve equations. By practicing and recognizing patterns, you'll master factoring in no time.  




Remember: **Factor, Check, and Verify!**

## Absolute Value




In mathematics, the **absolute value** of a number refers to its *distance* from zero on a number line, regardless of its direction (positive or negative).




### Definition
The absolute value of a number \( x \) is denoted as \( |x| \).




\[
|x| = \begin{cases}
    x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
    -x & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}
\]




This means:
- If \( x \) is positive or zero, the absolute value is \( x \).
- If \( x \) is negative, the absolute value is \( -x \), which makes it positive.




### Examples
1. \( |5| = 5 \) (\( 5 \) is already positive, so it stays the same).
2. \( |-7| = 7 \) (\( -7 \) is negative, so we take \( -(-7) = 7 \)).
3. \( |0| = 0 \) (The absolute value of zero is zero).




### Graphical Definition
The absolute value represents the distance from zero:
- \( |3| = 3 \) means \( 3 \) is 3 units away from zero.
- \( |-3| = 3 \) means \( -3 \) is also 3 units away from zero.




```
Number Line:
<--- -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3 --->
|3| = 3 and |-3| = 3
```




### Solving Absolute Value
To solve equations involving absolute values, you need to split the equation into two cases because the value inside the absolute value can be positive or negative.




**Example:** Solve \( |x| = 4 \).




\[
|x| = 4 \implies \begin{cases}
    x = 4 \\
    x = -4
\end{cases}
\]




So the solutions are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -4 \).




### Absolute Value Inequalities
1. **For \( |x| < a \) (where \( a > 0 \))**:
   \[
   |x| < a \implies -a < x < a
   \]
   Example: \( |x| < 3 \implies -3 < x < 3 \).




2. **For \( |x| > a \) (where \( a > 0 \))**:
   \[
   |x| > a \implies x < -a \; \text{or} \; x > a
   \]
   Example: \( |x| > 3 \implies x < -3 \; \text{or} \; x > 3 \).




### Key Properties
1. **Non-negativity**: \( |x| \geq 0 \).
2. **Identity**: \( |x| = 0 \iff x = 0 \).
3. **Multiplicative Property**: \( |a \cdot b| = |a| \cdot |b| \).
4. **Additive Property**: \( |a + b| \leq |a| + |b| \) (Triangle Inequality).




### Summary Table



| **Input ($x$)** | **Output $\|x\|$** |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 5               | 5                 |
| -7              | 7                 |
| 0               | 0                 |
| -12             | 12                |






---




Now you know that absolute value focuses only on the magnitude of a number (how far it is from zero) without worrying about its sign!





## Intro to Statistics

### Definition
Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data.

### Key Concepts
1. **Mean (Average):** Sum of all values divided by the number of values.
2. **Median:** The middle value when data is ordered from least to greatest.
3. **Mode:** The most frequently occurring value(s) in a data set.
4. **Range:** Difference between the largest and smallest values.

### Examples
1. **Mean:** Data: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. Mean = (2+4+6+8+10)/5 = 6.
2. **Median:** Data: 3, 7, 9, 12, 15. Median = 9.
3. **Mode:** Data: 5, 5, 7, 9, 9, 9. Mode = 9.
4. **Range:** Data: 10, 15, 20, 25. Range = 25 - 10 = 15.

### Practice Problems
1. Find the mean of 4, 8, 12, 16.
2. Identify the median of 10, 14, 18, 20, 22.
3. Determine the mode of 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, 7, 7, 9.
4. Calculate the range of 25, 30, 35, 40, 45.

### Conclusion
Understanding basic statistics helps analyze and interpret data in everyday life, from sports to finance.

## Order of Operations Explained

### Definition
The order of operations is the set of rules that defines the sequence in which mathematical operations are performed.

### PEMDAS
PEMDAS stands for:
- **P**: Parentheses
- **E**: Exponents
- **M/D**: Multiplication/Division (from left to right)
- **A/S**: Addition/Subtraction (from left to right)

### Examples
1. \( 3 + 6 \times 2 \) = 3 + 12 = 15.
2. \( (2 + 3)^2 \times 4 \) = 5^2 \times 4 = 25 \times 4 = 100.
3. \( 12 \div (3 + 1) \times 2 \) = 12 \div 4 \times 2 = 3 \times 2 = 6.

### Practice Problems
1. \( 7 + 3 \times 5 \).
2. \( (8 + 2)^2 \div 5 \).
3. \( 15 \div (5 - 2) + 4 \).
4. \( 6 \times (3 + 4) - 2 \).

### Conclusion
Remembering PEMDAS ensures accurate calculations in all mathematical problems.

## Inequality Symbols Explanation

### Definition
Inequality symbols are used to compare values or expressions, showing the relationship between them.

### Key Symbols
1. **<**: Less than
2. **>**: Greater than
3. **≤**: Less than or equal to
4. **≥**: Greater than or equal to
5. **≠**: Not equal to

### Examples
1. \( 3 < 5 \): 3 is less than 5.
2. \( 10 > 7 \): 10 is greater than 7.
3. \( 6 \leq 6 \): 6 is less than or equal to 6.
4. \( 8 \geq 5 \): 8 is greater than or equal to 5.
5. \( 4 \neq 3 \): 4 is not equal to 3.

### Practice Problems
1. Compare: 7 __ 10.
2. Compare: 15 __ 15.
3. Compare: -3 __ -5.
4. Compare: 0 __ 5.



### Conclusion
Understanding inequality symbols is essential for solving equations and comparing values in math.

## Math: Complex Numbers

### Definition
In mathematics, complex numbers consist of a real part and an imaginary part. A complex number is expressed as \( a + bi \), where:
- \( a \) is the real part
- \( b \) is the imaginary part
- \( i \) is the imaginary unit, where \( i = \sqrt{-1} \)

### Example
For the complex number \( 3 + 4i \):
- The real part is \( 3 \)
- The imaginary part is \( 4i \)

### Key Operations with Complex Numbers

1. **Addition and Subtraction**:
   - To add or subtract complex numbers, combine their real and imaginary parts separately.
   - Example: \( (3 + 4i) + (1 + 2i) = (3 + 1) + (4i + 2i) = 4 + 6i \)
   
2. **Multiplication**:
   - Multiply complex numbers by applying distributive property and simplifying using \( i^2 = -1 \).
   - Example: \( (3 + 4i) \times (1 + 2i) = 3(1 + 2i) + 4i(1 + 2i) = 3 + 6i + 4i + 8i^2 = 3 + 10i - 8 = -5 + 10i \)

3. **Conjugates**:
   - The conjugate of a complex number \( a + bi \) is \( a - bi \).
   - Example: The conjugate of \( 3 + 4i \) is \( 3 - 4i \).

### Practice Problems
1. Add: \( (2 + 3i) + (4 + 2i) \).
2. Subtract: \( (5 + 6i) - (1 + 3i) \).
3. Multiply: \( (1 + 2i) \times (3 + 4i) \).
4. Find the conjugate of \( 6 + 7i \).

### Conclusion
Complex numbers extend the number system to include the square roots of negative numbers. They have many applications in engineering, physics, and signal processing.


---

## Linear Algebra

### Vector Spaces
A **vector space** is a collection of vectors that can be added together and multiplied by scalars (real numbers), satisfying specific properties.

### Key Properties
1. **Additive Closure**: The sum of two vectors is also a vector.
2. **Multiplicative Closure**: A vector multiplied by a scalar is still a vector.
3. **Commutativity and Associativity**: Addition and scalar multiplication follow the usual rules.
4. **Existence of Zero Vector**: There exists a zero vector that does not change other vectors when added.

### Examples
1. **Example 1**: Let \( \vec{v} = (1, 2) \) and \( \vec{w} = (3, 4) \). The sum \( \vec{v} + \vec{w} = (1+3, 2+4) = (4, 6) \), which is also a vector.
2. **Example 2**: For scalar \( c = 2 \), multiplying \( \vec{v} = (1, 2) \) by \( c \), we get \( c\vec{v} = 2(1, 2) = (2, 4) \), which is still a vector.

---

### Matrices
A **matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.

### Operations
1. **Addition**: Matrices of the same size can be added by adding corresponding elements.
2. **Multiplication**: Matrices can be multiplied if the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix.

### Example
Matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix} \) and matrix \( B = \begin{pmatrix} 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 \end{pmatrix} \).

1. **Addition**:  
\( A + B = \begin{pmatrix} 1+5 & 2+6 \\ 3+7 & 4+8 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 & 8 \\ 10 & 12 \end{pmatrix} \).

2. **Multiplication**:  
\( A \times B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \times 5 + 2 \times 7 & 1 \times 6 + 2 \times 8 \\ 3 \times 5 + 4 \times 7 & 3 \times 6 + 4 \times 8 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 19 & 22 \\ 43 & 50 \end{pmatrix} \).

---

### Determinants
The **determinant** of a matrix is a scalar value that can be computed from its elements and determines if a matrix has an inverse.

### Example
For a 2x2 matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \), the determinant is:
\[
\text{det}(A) = ad - bc
\]

---

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
An **eigenvalue** is a scalar \( \lambda \) such that for some vector \( \vec{v} \), the matrix \( A \) acting on \( \vec{v} \) scales \( \vec{v} \) by \( \lambda \), i.e., \( A\vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v} \).

### Example
For matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix} \), eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation:
\[
\text{det}(A - \lambda I) = 0
\]
Where \( I \) is the identity matrix.

---

### Practice Problems
1. Find the sum of two vectors \( \vec{v} = (1, 3) \) and \( \vec{w} = (4, 6) \).
2. Multiply the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix} \) by scalar \( 2 \).
3. Compute the determinant of \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 5 & 2 \\ 3 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \).
4. Find the eigenvalues of matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix} \).

---

### Conclusion
Linear algebra is essential for understanding systems of equations, vector spaces, transformations, and many more applications. Keep practicing these concepts to develop a strong foundation.

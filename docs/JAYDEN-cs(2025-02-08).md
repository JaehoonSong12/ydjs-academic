# Difference Between CLI and GUI

## CLI (Command Line Interface)
- **What it is:** A text-based interface where users type commands to interact with the system.
- **How it works:** You type a command like `dir` (on Windows) or `ls` (on Linux) to list files, and the system responds with text.
- **Example:** You open a terminal and type commands like `mkdir newfolder` to create a new folder.
- **Pros:**
  - More powerful for advanced tasks.
  - Faster for experienced users.
  - Takes up less system resources.
- **Cons:**
  - Requires memorizing commands.
  - Can be intimidating for beginners.

## GUI (Graphical User Interface)
- **What it is:** A visual interface with icons, buttons, and windows that users click to interact with the system.
- **How it works:** You click on icons or buttons instead of typing commands. For example, to open a folder, you click on its icon.
- **Example:** You use a file explorer like Windows File Explorer to navigate and open files.
- **Pros:**
  - Easy to use, especially for beginners.
  - More intuitive with visual cues.
  - No need to remember commands.
- **Cons:**
  - Can be slower for advanced tasks.
  - Consumes more system resources (like memory and CPU).

## Similarities:
- Both are interfaces to interact with a computer system.
- Both can be used to perform the same tasks (like managing files or running applications).

## Differences:
- **CLI** is text-based and requires typing commands, while **GUI** is visual and involves clicking with a mouse.
- **CLI** is often preferred by advanced users or developers because it's faster and more powerful for certain tasks, while **GUI** is easier and more user-friendly for beginners.


# Class and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which are instances of classes. These objects can contain both **data** (attributes or properties) and **functions** (methods or behaviors).

## Key Concepts in OOP:

1. **Class**: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors that objects created from the class will have.
   
   - **Example**: A class `Car` might define properties like `color`, `model`, and `speed`, and behaviors like `accelerate()` and `brake()`.

2. **Object**: An instance of a class. When you create an object, you are creating a concrete instance that has specific values for the properties defined in the class.
   
   - **Example**: An object of the `Car` class could be a red, 2020 Toyota Camry with a `speed` of 60 mph.

3. **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, the class. This helps hide the internal state and allows controlled access to it.

4. **Inheritance**: The ability for one class to inherit the properties and behaviors of another. This allows for code reuse and the creation of hierarchies.
   
   - **Example**: A `SportsCar` class could inherit from the `Car` class and add more specific behaviors, like `turboBoost()`.

5. **Polymorphism**: The ability to use a method in different ways. For example, a method with the same name could behave differently depending on the object that calls it.
   
   - **Example**: The `accelerate()` method could be defined in both the `Car` and `Truck` classes, but each would behave differently based on the type of vehicle.

6. **Abstraction**: Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It helps reduce complexity and allows the user to focus on what the object does rather than how it does it.

## History of Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming is not a new concept. It has evolved over time through several programming languages and paradigms.

## Early Days:
- **1960s**: The origins of OOP can be traced back to early programming languages like **Simula**, which was developed at the **Norwegian Computing Center** (Norsk Regnesentral). Simula introduced the concept of **objects** and **classes**, specifically for simulating real-world systems.
  
- **1970s**: **Smalltalk**, developed at **Xerox PARC**, became one of the first languages to fully embrace OOP concepts, such as inheritance and polymorphism. Smalltalk influenced many later OOP languages.

## The Rise of OOP:
- **1980s**: Object-Oriented Programming gained popularity due to its use in **software engineering** and **complex systems modeling**. Languages like **C++** (which combined procedural and object-oriented features) and **Objective-C** emerged, making OOP more accessible.

## The Mainstream Adoption:
- **1990s**: The introduction of languages like **Java** and **Python** made OOP a mainstream paradigm for software development. Java, in particular, made OOP its core foundation, with a strong emphasis on classes and objects.
  
- **2000s and beyond**: As technology and software development grew more complex, OOP continued to be the dominant programming paradigm. Frameworks and libraries in languages like **Ruby**, **C#**, and **Swift** made it easier to build scalable, maintainable systems.

---

## Advantages of OOP:
- **Modularity**: Objects and classes are self-contained, making code easier to manage and debug.
- **Reusability**: Inheritance allows classes to reuse code, reducing duplication.
- **Scalability**: OOP helps in managing large codebases with complex relationships.
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update and maintain code as objects can be modified independently.

## Create an object (instance) of the Car class
my_car = Car("red", "Toyota Camry", 50)

## Call methods on the object
my_car.accelerate()
my_car.brake()

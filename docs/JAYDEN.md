# Math: SAT


## What is Factored Form?

Factored form is a way of writing a polynomial as the product of its factors. Factoring simplifies expressions, helps solve equations, and identifies roots (solutions).

### Example:  
A quadratic equation in standard form:  
**ax² + bx + c**  

Can be written in factored form:  
**a(x - r₁)(x - r₂)**  

Where **r₁** and **r₂** are the roots.  

✅ Example:  
**x² - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)**  

---

## Why Use Factored Form?

Factored form is important because it:  
- Helps find the roots (solutions) of an equation.  
- Simplifies algebraic expressions.  
- Makes graphing easier by identifying intercepts.  
- Is used in real-world problems like physics and engineering.

---

## Steps to Factor an Expression

Follow these steps to factor any expression:

1. **Look for a GCF**:  
   Factor out the greatest common factor from all terms.

2. **Count the terms**:  
   - **2 terms** → Check for a difference of squares.  
   - **3 terms** → Factor as a trinomial.  
   - **4 terms** → Try factoring by grouping.  

3. **Factor step by step**:  
   Use methods like the **AC Method** for trinomials.

4. **Check for special cases**:  
   Recognize patterns like perfect squares or differences of squares.

5. **Verify**:  
   Expand your factors to ensure they match the original expression.

---

## Types of Factoring

### 1. Factoring Out the GCF

Always start by factoring out the **greatest common factor**.  

✅ Example:  
**6x² + 12x**  
**GCF = 6x**  
**6x² + 12x = 6x(x + 2)**  

---

### 2. Factoring Trinomials

For an expression in the form **ax² + bx + c**:  
- Find two numbers that multiply to **ac** and add to **b**.

✅ Example:  
**x² + 5x + 6**  
The numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 5 are **2 and 3**.  
**x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)**  

---

### 3. Factoring by Grouping

Use grouping when there are **4 terms**.  

✅ Example:  
**x³ + 2x² + x + 2**  
Group terms:  
**(x³ + 2x²) + (x + 2)**  
Factor out the GCF from each group:  
**x²(x + 2) + 1(x + 2)**  
Combine:  
**(x² + 1)(x + 2)**  

---

### 4. Factoring Special Cases

1. **Difference of Squares**:  
   **a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)**  

   ✅ Example:  
   **x² - 16 = (x + 4)(x - 4)**  

2. **Perfect Square Trinomials**:  
   - **a² + 2ab + b² = (a + b)²**  
   - **a² - 2ab + b² = (a - b)²**  

   ✅ Example:  
   **x² + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)²**  

---

## Examples

1. **Factoring Out the GCF**  
   Factor **12x² + 18x**:  
   **GCF = 6x**  
   **12x² + 18x = 6x(2x + 3)**  

2. **Factoring a Trinomial**  
   Factor **x² + 7x + 10**:  
   Find numbers that multiply to 10 and add to 7 → **2 and 5**.  
   **x² + 7x + 10 = (x + 2)(x + 5)**  

3. **Factoring by Grouping**  
   Factor **2x³ + 4x² + 3x + 6**:  
   Group terms: **(2x³ + 4x²) + (3x + 6)**  
   Factor GCF: **2x²(x + 2) + 3(x + 2)**  
   Combine: **(2x² + 3)(x + 2)**  

4. **Factoring a Difference of Squares**  
   Factor **x² - 49**:  
   **x² - 49 = (x + 7)(x - 7)**  

---

## Tips for Factoring

- Always start by factoring out the **GCF**.  
- Recognize patterns like perfect squares or differences of squares.  
- Use the **AC Method** to factor trinomials efficiently.  
- Expand your factors to check your work.  

---

## Practice Problems

Try these problems on your own:  

1. Factor **x² + 8x + 15**.  
2. Factor **3x² + 12x + 9**.  
3. Factor **x² - 36**.  
4. Factor **4x³ + 8x² + 2x + 4**.  
5. Factor **x³ - x² - 6x + 6**.  

---

## Conclusion

Factored form is a fundamental concept in algebra that simplifies polynomials and helps solve equations. By practicing and recognizing patterns, you'll master factoring in no time.  

Remember: **Factor, Check, and Verify!**  



## Absolute Value

In mathematics, the **absolute value** of a number refers to its *distance* from zero on a number line, regardless of its direction (positive or negative).

### Definition
The absolute value of a number \( x \) is denoted as \( |x| \).

\[
|x| = \begin{cases} 
    x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
    -x & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}
\]

This means:
- If \( x \) is positive or zero, the absolute value is \( x \).
- If \( x \) is negative, the absolute value is \( -x \), which makes it positive.

### Examples
1. \( |5| = 5 \) (\( 5 \) is already positive, so it stays the same).
2. \( |-7| = 7 \) (\( -7 \) is negative, so we take \( -(-7) = 7 \)).
3. \( |0| = 0 \) (The absolute value of zero is zero).

### Graphical Definition
The absolute value represents the distance from zero:
- \( |3| = 3 \) means \( 3 \) is 3 units away from zero.
- \( |-3| = 3 \) means \( -3 \) is also 3 units away from zero.

```
Number Line:
<--- -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3 --->
|3| = 3 and |-3| = 3
```

### Solving Absolute Value Equations
To solve equations involving absolute values, you need to split the equation into two cases because the value inside the absolute value can be positive or negative.

**Example:** Solve \( |x| = 4 \).

\[
|x| = 4 \implies \begin{cases}
    x = 4 \\
    x = -4
\end{cases}
\]

So the solutions are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = -4 \).

### Absolute Value Inequalities
1. **For \( |x| < a \) (where \( a > 0 \))**:
   \[
   |x| < a \implies -a < x < a
   \]
   Example: \( |x| < 3 \implies -3 < x < 3 \).

2. **For \( |x| > a \) (where \( a > 0 \))**:
   \[
   |x| > a \implies x < -a \; \text{or} \; x > a
   \]
   Example: \( |x| > 3 \implies x < -3 \; \text{or} \; x > 3 \).

### Key Properties of Absolute Value
1. **Non-negativity**: \( |x| \geq 0 \).
2. **Identity**: \( |x| = 0 \iff x = 0 \).
3. **Multiplicative Property**: \( |a \cdot b| = |a| \cdot |b| \).
4. **Additive Property**: \( |a + b| \leq |a| + |b| \) (Triangle Inequality).

### Summary Table
| Input (\( x \)) | Output (\( |x| \)) |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 5               | 5                 |
| -7              | 7                 |
| 0               | 0                 |
| -12             | 12                |

---

Now you know that absolute value focuses only on the magnitude of a number (how far it is from zero) without worrying about its sign!

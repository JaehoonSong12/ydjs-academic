/**
 * Exercise01 contains methods that help practice:
 * 1. Writing `functions` and evaluating `expressions`.
 * 2. Learning `String formatting` to manipulate strings using variables. 
 * This exercise also involves basic arithmetic operations and formatted string output.
 * 
 * The methods in this class include:
 * - `listen`: Calculates total time spent listening to songs and podcasts.
 * - `dominosTime`: Calculates the total cost of a food order.
 * - `tipAndSplit`: Calculates the tip amount and per-person cost based on a bill.
 * - `youtuber`: Calculates total earnings from YouTube videos based on views.
 * - `bathBomb`: Calculates the volume of a bath bomb given its radius.
